# advent-of-code-2020

My solutions to this year's programming puzzles, shared on GitHub at
the request of some of my coworkers.

## Usage

Just open a Clojure REPL on the project, and tweak and invoke the
appropriate functions. I expect most everything will stay in the core
namespace, but will hopefully remember to update this if they grow
enough to merit splitting into other namespaces.

## Extra Solutions

I also decided to go back and work on the problems for 2017 after a
coworker raved about how much fun they were. They are grouped into
their own folders and namespaces.
